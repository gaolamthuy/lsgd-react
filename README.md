# Local development with docker

## Start development environment
Add `-d` to get run detached mode in terminal, dev server ready at port 3000
```bash
sudo docker-compose -f ~/lsgd-react/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

## Install new dependency

Start the container in interactive mode with a shell:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app sh
```

Run the `npm install` command to install the new dependency:

```bash
npm install axios
```

Exit the container:

```bash
exit
```

This will install the `axios` package in the `node_modules` directory within the container. However, as I mentioned earlier, it will not automatically update the `package.json` file.

To update the `package.json` file with the new dependency, you can run the `npm install` command again with the `--save` flag:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app npm install --save axios
```

This will install the `axios` package and add it to the `dependencies` section of the `package.json` file.

After updating the `package.json` file, you may need to rebuild the Docker image to incorporate the changes. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

## Deploy to production

*You should handle .env manually*

```
sudo docker-compose -f ~/lsgd-react/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build --force-recreate -d
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
